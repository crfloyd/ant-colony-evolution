# Evolutionary Mechanics Suggestions

Here are some evolutionary mechanics that could make the simulation more interesting:

## Checklist

### 1. Genetic Traits & Inheritance
- [ ] Give each ant heritable traits: speed, energy efficiency, vision range, carry capacity
- [ ] New ants inherit from a colony gene pool with occasional mutations
- [ ] Visualize diversity with subtle color variations

### 2. Performance-Based Selection
- [ ] Track individual ant performance (food delivered, distance traveled, survival time)
- [ ] Successful ants contribute more to the gene pool when spawning
- [ ] Failed ants (starved/inefficient) contribute less

### 3. Emergent Specialization
- [ ] Remove fixed scout/forager roles
- [ ] Let high-vision, low-carry ants naturally become scouts
- [ ] Let high-carry, efficient ants become foragers
- [ ] Evolution discovers optimal role distribution

### 4. Environmental Pressure
- [ ] Add seasonal food scarcity periods
- [ ] Distance penalties (farther food = selection for speed/efficiency)
- [ ] Dense obstacle areas favor pathfinding traits

### 5. Colony-Level Evolution
- [ ] Multiple colonies competing for resources
- [ ] Colony traits: pheromone decay rates, spawn thresholds, role ratios
- [ ] Successful colonies spread their strategies

### 6. Trait Tradeoffs
- [ ] Fast ants consume more energy
- [ ] Large vision range = higher energy drain
- [ ] High carry capacity = slower movement
- [ ] Forces balanced evolution, not min-maxing

**Recommendation:** Start with **Genetic Traits & Inheritance** since it builds on the existing spawning system and would be visually interesting to watch evolve.
